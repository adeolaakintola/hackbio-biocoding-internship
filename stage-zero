#providing solution to the stage zero task in the hackbio internship
#the task is to use a data structure of our choice to organize the following information: your name, your slack_username, your email, your hubby, your country, your discipline, your preferred programming language
#since this is a mapping task, I decided to use the dictionary data structure in python
#link to my repo: https://github.com/adeolaakintola/hackbio-biocoding-internship.git
#Your names = Adeola Akintola
#Your slack username = adeolaa
#Your email = akintolaadeola09@gmail.com
#Your hobby = Surfing for information
#Your countries = Nigeria
#Your discipline = Public Health
#Your preferred programming language = Python
